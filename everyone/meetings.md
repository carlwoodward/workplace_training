# Meetings

Programmers hate meetings but they are necessary for communication and planning.

## Must do

1. Everyone in the company **must** take notes. These notes need to be as detailed as possible. A notepad is great for this but if you prefer another device that is fine. As long as it is **always** with you, even when you are out at lunch.
2. Everyone **must** be on time for meetings (without fail). If you are going to be late (even by 3 minutes) you must let the organiser know. Don't be early either. Chances are the organiser has planned out their day to the minute and you need to respect that.
3. Every meeting **must** have an agenda. (See example below). If there isn't an agenda then the meeting should be cancelled. If the meeting is just a **catch up**, make sure you call it that and organise it to be over coffee or at the pub. Meetings must have an agenda and an outcome.
4. Every meeting **must** be followed up by an email with written notes from the meeting detailing the outcomes and task assignments.

## Nice to have

1. Try to have one day per week set aside for meetings. This can be tricky with external meetings but even if this rule is only used for internal meetings, it will allow programmers to focus on their work and building the best products possible.
2. Send the agenda to all participants at least 2 days before the meeting.
3. If the answers can be figured out without a meeting, then it's perfectly reasonable to cancel the meeting.
