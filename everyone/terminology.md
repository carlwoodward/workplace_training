# Terminology

This document assumes very little knowledge about technology.

## Resources

Resources should be removed from the vocabulary of your company. The term became popular when human resource departments were created but it is important to understand that people doing the same role don't have the same strengths and weaknesses. And people make your company/product great, not resources. In todays terms most resources (e.g. coal) are used up. People aren't to be used up. They are to be built up. Replace the word resources with people.

## Data

Understanding some basic data structures can help the whole team align around the software that is being built.

- Structure - a set of fields e.g. a person structure might have the follow fields: first name, last name, email, mobile number, etc
- An array - a way of grouping many structures into a list, e.g. if you had multiple people you could put them into an array like this (liz, fred, jane)

These are the basic building blocks of all programs.
