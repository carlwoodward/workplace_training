# Workplace Training

A simple set of cheatsheets for training people working in companies that build software.

These cheatsheets are derived from training provided by Pablo Bawdekar which he developed at Quidnunc New York. They are intended for the following audiences:

- People writing software
- People managing people who write software (both directly and indirectly)

Each cheatsheet is intended to be used to prepare for and complete a task until the person is comfortable with the steps and ideas. It is useful to go over the cheatsheets periodically, particularly when training someone new.

There are three directories:

- programmers - details specific to the task of building software
- managers - required reading for people managing programmers including team leads
- everyone - relevant for everyone who interacts with any programmer

Please feel free to submit changes to this repo.
